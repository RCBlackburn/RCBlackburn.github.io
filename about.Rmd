My research focuses on the use of remote sensing techniques to enhance land management efforts towards creating more resilient ecosystems. Currently, my work applies machine learning methods to lidar derived datasets in order to assess the structure and composition of Southwestern forests. This research aims to provide efficient and accurate estimates of forest conditions for resource managers, which will then be used to monitor and predict outcomes from drivers of forest change (e.g., wildfires, management decisions, climate change).
